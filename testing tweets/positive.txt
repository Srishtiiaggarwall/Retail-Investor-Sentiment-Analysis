Originally bought $33k in AAPL in Mar/Apr 2014.  Since then I've received over $39k in re-invested dividends and am up almost 900%.  This isn't a trade, it's a buy and hold for future generational wealth with probably 2-3 stock splits between now and when I retire.  If you're new, pick a dip and buy in and then continue to buy and accumulate on all dips and reinvest the dividends and you won't be sorry.
